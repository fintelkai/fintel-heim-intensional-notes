  abstract        = {The Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis of negative polarity
                  licensing (that NPIs are licensed in the scope of downward
                  entailing operators) continues to be the benchmark theory of
                  negative polarity. In this paper, I consider some of the moves
                  that are needed to maintain its basic intuition in some
                  recalcitrant arenas: negative polarity licensing by only,
                  adversatives, superlatives, and conditionals. We will see that
                  one has to (i) use a notion of entailment that I call Strawson
                  Entailment, which deals with presuppositions in a particular
                  way, and (ii) prohibit (even natural) context change during an
                  inference. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to
                  justify these constraints and to see in detail how the
                  semantics of the problematic constructions has to work in
                  order for these moves to successfully rescue the
                  Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis. I will first show the two
                  assumptions at work in the analysis of NPI licensing by only
                  and adversatives (building on proposals by Kadmon & Landman).
                  I then turn to NPI licensing in the antecedent of
                  conditionals. The standard Stalnaker-Lewis semantics for
                  conditionals - if p, q is true if q is true in the closest
                  p-world(s) - might make one suspect that once one has an
                  explanation for NPI licensing by superlatives, that would
                  immediately deliver an explanation for NPI licensing in
                  conditionals. But it turns out that the particular analysis
                  that seems appropriate for NPI licensing by superlatives
                  cannot plausibly carry over to conditionals. Instead, one does
                  better by appealing to an alternative analysis of
                  conditionals, one that I have elsewhere argued for on
                  independent grounds.},
